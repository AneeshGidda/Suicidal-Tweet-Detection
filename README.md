## Introduction
Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) task that involves determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in a piece of text. In this project, we use the DistilBERT model to classify Twitter-based posts into two categories: "Not Suicide" and "Potential Suicide." This classification can provide insights into identifying posts that may indicate individuals at risk of self-harm or suicide

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be obtained from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aunanya875/suicidal-tweet-detection-dataset). Make sure to preprocess the data as described in the project code before training and testing the model

## DistilBERT Overview
DistilBERT is a distilled version of the BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model, designed to provide similar performance to BERT but with a significantly smaller model size. It was introduced as a more computationally efficient alternative, making it suitable for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

## How DistilBERT Works
DistilBERT operates on the same fundamental principles as BERT, which is a transformer-based model. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

Tokenization: Like BERT, DistilBERT tokenizes input text into smaller units, such as words or subwords. It uses WordPiece tokenization, where it breaks down words into smaller subword units to handle out-of-vocabulary words efficiently.

Word Embeddings: DistilBERT converts tokens into dense vector representations (word embeddings) using pre-trained embeddings. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of each token.

Transformer Architecture: DistilBERT employs the transformer architecture, which consists of multiple layers of self-attention and feedforward neural networks. It processes input tokens in parallel across these layers, allowing it to capture contextual information from both sides of the token sequence.

Self-Attention Mechanism: In the self-attention mechanism, DistilBERT calculates attention scores between all tokens in the input sequence. These scores determine how much each token should attend to others, allowing the model to capture dependencies and relationships between tokens.

Layer Stacking: DistilBERT has fewer transformer layers compared to BERT, typically around half the number. However, these layers are still effective in capturing contextual information while reducing the model's size.

Training: DistilBERT is pre-trained on a massive corpus of text data, learning to predict masked tokens within sentences. This unsupervised pre-training helps the model acquire language understanding and general knowledge.

Fine-Tuning: After pre-training, DistilBERT can be fine-tuned on specific downstream NLP tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, or question-answering. Fine-tuning adjusts the model's parameters to make it perform well on a particular task.

## Benefits of DistilBERT
DistilBERT offers several advantages:

Reduced Model Size: DistilBERT is smaller and faster than BERT while maintaining competitive performance, making it more accessible for deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Computational Efficiency: Due to its reduced size, DistilBERT requires fewer computational resources for both training and inference, resulting in faster model training and lower operational costs.

Good Generalization: DistilBERT's pre-training on a diverse text corpus allows it to generalize well to various NLP tasks without extensive fine-tuning.

State-of-the-Art Performance: DistilBERT often achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple NLP benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness despite its smaller size.
